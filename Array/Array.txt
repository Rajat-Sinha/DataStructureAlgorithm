Array List
	A collection of elements/values each identified by an array index or key
	
	For multidimensional array:
		x[2][3] = 2 is row index and 3 is column index
	Array is 0(1)
	but Reconstructing array as to create bigger array is o(N)
	Most imp. features of array is the random access to the data
Arrays Operation
	Adding
		Adding a value to empty array can be done untill array is full with o(1)
	Insert
		Inserting value to empty  array is very fast with O(1) operations
		Inserting the values to the end of the list is constant time complexities with o(1)
		But Inserting the values at the begining of the array is linear time complexities with O(N) as we have to shift the items
		Inserting values to a index in which another valu exists for this we have to shift the value then insert new value  and this is o(N) linear time complexities
	Remove
		Remove the last item is constant time complexities with o(1)  very simple
		Removing a value with a given index is linear time complexities with o(N) not simple as we have to shift the item

An algorithm is made up of two independent time complexities f (n) and g (n). Then the complexities of the algorithm is in the order of max(f(n),g(n))
		
The expected number of inversions in any permutation on n elements is O(N^2)
		
The minimum number of comparisons required to determine if a given integer appears more than n/2 times in a sorted array of n integers is O(logN)		
	Linearly search for the first occurrence of the element, once you find it (let at index i), check element at index i+n/2. If element is present at i+n/2 then return true else return false.

Suppose the array is of size n and sorted in ascending order, then
	The ith largest element would be simply the array[n−i] element.
	Also, the ith smallest element would be simply the array[i−1] element.
	While, the worst case time complexity for deleting an element from array can become O(n).	
In C, we cannot have an array of void type and function types. For example, below program throws compiler error

X[i][j][k]'th element in one dimensional array is equivalent to X[i*j*k + j*k + k]'th element in one dimensional array (Note that multi-dimensional arrays are stored in row major order i

In C/C++, if we initialize an array with fewer members, all remaining members are automatically initialized as 0

Applying the Address-of(&) operator before the array name gives the address of the whole array. Adding 1 to this address gives the address plus the sizeof whole array.

*a = a[0]
a[1] = *(a+1)
a[i][j] = *(*(a+i)+j)

The complexity of multiplying two matrices of order m*n and n*p is m*n*p

Two dimensional arrays are also called
	Tables arrays
	Matrix arrays
A variable P is called pointer if	P contains the address of an element in DATA.
Records store the homogeneous data elements.
Each data item in a record may be a group item composed of sub-items; those items which are indecomposable are called elementary items,atoms,scalars

The difference between linear array and a record is
	An array is suitable for homogeneous data but hte data items in a record may have different data type
	In a record, there may not be a natural ordering in opposed to linear array.
	A record form a hierarchical structure but a lienear array does not
