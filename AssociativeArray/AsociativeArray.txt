AssociativeArrays:
	AssociativeArrays / maps/ dictionaries are abstract data types
	Composed of a collection of key-value pairs where each key appears only once in the collection
	Most of the times we implment associative arrays with  hashtables but binary search trees can be used as well
	The aim is to reach O(1) time complexity for most of the  operations
	Supported Operations:
		Adding key-value pairs to the collections
		Removing key-value pairs from the collection
		Update existing key-value pairs
		Lookup of value associated with a given key(Search operation)
		Do not support sort operation for hash wrap
