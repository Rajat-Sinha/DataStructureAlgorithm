Data Structures is to store data in an efficient way
Data Structures mak sure that the running time will be better  for an algorithm

following data structure is not non-linear type?
	Strings
	Lists
	Stacks

Dijkstra algorithm
	Without a proper data structure (heap/ proirity queue) the running time would be quadratic // O(N^2)
	Prority queue approach makes sure the runnning time will be far better // (ON*logN)
