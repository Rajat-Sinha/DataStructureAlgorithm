Abstract data types
	Basically this is the model (logical description for a certain data structure)
	It is super type in programming(so an interface in java)
	stack->push() 
		is going to add an item in the datastructure
	stack->pop() 
		is going to return and retrieve an item from the data structure
	stack->peek() 
		is going to return an item without removing it from the data structure
Data structure
	concrete implementation , actual representaion of the data
	Aim is to be able to store and retrieve data in an efeicient manner
Abstract data types      data structure
	Stack					array,linkedlist
	Queue					array,linkedlist
	Prority queue				heap
	Dictionary/hashmap			array
The above table means that stack abstract data types with concerte behaviours and we can implement stack with the help of array or linked list

ABT abd data structure are not independent from each other

Abstract data types  are the specification and every abstract data types have an underlying data structure that's going to implement the behaviour that has been specified in the abstract
