Double LinkedList:
	They are composed of nodes and refrences/pointers pointing from one node to the other
	The last and first refrences are poniters to a Null
	We can access the head as well as tails as both are pointing towards null
	Node class has two refrences
		one pointing to the next node
		one pointing to the previous node
	A single node:
		contains data-> can be an integer,double or custom object
		contains a refrence/poniters pointing to the next node in the linked list
		contains a refrence/poniters pointing to the previous node in the linked list
		class Node{
			data
			Node nextNode
			Node prevNode
		}
		Can be traversed both directions forward as well as backward
Removing the item 
	O(1) time complexities
	we need the node only
